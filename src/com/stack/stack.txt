histogram have interval but bar don't.

histogram problem is solved in O(n^2) by brute force
O(nlogn) by divide and conqure
O(n) by stack.

Add to stack if current value is bigger or equal o top of stack.otherwise keep removinf from stack untill smaller or equal
to current is not found.
calculate area every time when we remove from stack.
area=inputarray[top]*i;  height of min bar*right
area=inputarray[top]*(i-stack top-1)  height of min bar (right most smaller element-left-1)
