skew tree a tree where a node have only one child.

binary tree a tree where each node one , two or zero child.Empty tree is also valid binary tree.

full binary tree where each node have exact two child and all leaf node are same level.

complete binary tree a tree where all leaf node are at h or h-1 level in a seq from left two right.

No of node at level h = 2^h

Tree is traversal

preorder(simplest)
postorder
inorder
level order based on BFS   above 3 are dfs based

at root level hight is start from 0.

treeset and treemap are using self balanced binary tree.

Diameter of tree is maximum no of edges bw two point. a simple soln is leftheight+rightheight but not work in all case

if we have more search operation then use avl because all search operation
happen in logn time.avl have at most 1 node diff in height
