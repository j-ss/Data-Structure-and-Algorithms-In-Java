In heap

Root node has minimum value from its desendator.
It is a complete binary tree.

Get minimum is O(1)
Build heap is O(n) but look like O(logn)
All other operation are O(logn)

In Java priority queue use min heap.

Diff bw min heap and self balanced tree.

self balancing tree perfrom all operation in O(logn)

heap is cache friendly.
Complete binary tree .where self balancing tree use red black tree which may or may not complete binary tree.
heap use array so random access.


Questions--
Build an heap from unsorted array.
Given an almost sorted array sort that array. use min heap(priority queue of k+1 size)
find k largest element in an unsorted array. make a max heap and pop k element.O(n+klogn)
or make a min heap of first k element and compare the root with remaining element if root is smaller then swap else do nothing.
k+(n-k)logk

merge k sorted array

use divide and conqure if all array have same size
use min heap also

find median of stream of data use max heap
