doubly linked list perform insert or delete in O(1) time where in singly its not possible.

circular linked list is used in stack queue and in computer resource allocation.

skip list they are alternate of binary search tree.

here we perform all operation in O(logn) time as in BST but BST require more overhead of
balancing and memory.Its require only O(n) space.

skip list are divided into levels. its ordered.
